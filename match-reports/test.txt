âš«ðŸ”´âš½ Farringdon 7 - 2 Willington Youth Blues âš½ðŸ”´âš«
An outstanding performance from the lads this morning in some very windy conditions, but this didn't disrupt our football. The lads executed everything we have worked on in training to transpire onto the pitch. We saw a team that would take trust in each other for free kicks and throw-ins, with no selfishness, and a desire to win the game as a team effort.

David, Joey, and Bradley were unstoppable todayâ€”each netting a brace and relentlessly chasing that elusive hat-trick. Their goals werenâ€™t just well-taken; they were brilliantly finished, showcasing sharp technique and composure under pressure. But it wasnâ€™t just about scoringâ€”each of them worked tirelessly off the ball, pressing, linking play, and driving the team forward in search of the next breakthrough.

Freddie was up against a strong setup today, but he handled this very well, showing strength and determination throughout to cover the back line. Also at the back, Lucas and Oliver rotated seamlessly at left back, reading the game well, picking out passes, and stepping in with key challenges to keep the pressure off.

Finley was outstanding once again between the sticks. His saves throughout were pure classâ€”quick reactions and great positioning, and getting the ball further up the pitch. Finley pulled off a belter of a save in the 2nd half, which fell kindly for a rebound for Willington to pull one back, gutted for Finley as he had done so well to save a great shot.

Joseph, Dawson, Tyler, and Jensen put in a relentless shift today, showing brilliant work rate to win the ball back and drive the team forward. Their energy and commitment were vital in keeping the pressure on and maintaining control in key moments, and the decisions they made on the pitch led to many opportunities.

Coming to the close of the game, we coaches both agreed there was one standout performance for the team today, and that was Keaton. It had been a while since Keaton had managed to play a full game for Farringdon, but today we saw a very confident, composed and fully switched-on player for 60 minutes. His mindset was brilliant, and we saw a player back at his best. And finally, to top it off, the lad stepped up for a free kick near the end of the game and put it into the top corner to finish off the game, well done lad!

To summarise, the boys all played their part today, great attitude and desire to win as a team, which we will take into the next game.
