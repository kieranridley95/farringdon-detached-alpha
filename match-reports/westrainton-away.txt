West Rainton VS Farringdon (2-0) - Defeat

A very good and contested game between both sides this morning. The boys played excellent, Despite playing excellent football and creating several decent chances, we couldn’t quite convert in front of goal—those opportunities that on another day would’ve found the back of the net just didn’t fall our way.

A few small defensive errors proved costly, leading to goals that ultimately denied us the points. These are areas we’ll focus on in Tuesday’s training as we prepare for the long season ahead. That said, the progress this team has made over the summer break is clear to see. The lads are developing beautifully, and today’s performance—despite the result—was full of promise. They’ll bounce back stronger, no doubt.

Credit to West Rainton, they were very well organised, very strong and we wish them the best for this season.
