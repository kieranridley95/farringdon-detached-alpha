Another strong contested game today from both sides which resulted in sharing a point a peice. A penalty saved, it almost wasn't going to be our day but the lads did well to come away from the game and avoid defeat. Joey grabbed his first goal in a Farra shirt today with an excellent finish. And Bradley right at the death from a corner assisted by Sonny found the back of the net with the last kick of the game.

MOTM - Finley - Sponsored by Steve Mulvaney Building Services - Fantastic in goal today pulling off some unbelievable saves, becoming a brilliant shot stopper with his quick reflexes improving every week.

Parents Player - Bradley - Dominant at right back and also solid in attack, Bradley's 2nd goal for this season and being a goal poacher he is, scored at the last kick of the game to rescue a point for the lads.
