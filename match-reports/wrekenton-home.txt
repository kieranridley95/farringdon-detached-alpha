The lads battled hard in a very well-contested game tonight in our cup fixture. Each player played their part tonight in a resilient performance. Bradley bagged himself the winning goal with another solid performance at right back. He rapidly broke down the right-hand side to get to the goal and put the ball into the net for the lads. Another well-deserved clean sheet from Finley, who put on a great display between the sticks right until the end. 

Goals Bradley ‚öΩÔ∏è

MOTM - Jenson - Started in the second half and put in a fantastic shift holding the midfield, changed the game defensively in midfield and showed the desire to win the ball back.

Parents Player - David (Sponsored by Wilkies Autos) and Joey (Sponsored by Wray's Painting and Decorating) - A joint award tonight for both boys, who were fantastic in attack tonight; both were unfortunate not to get on the score sheet. Still, their performances were brilliant and a nice one for Joey to pick up on his debut.

Thank you to all parents and our sponsors, Swim City and T W kitchen & Bedroom installation, for your continued support.

Thank you to Wrekenton for a fantastic game. All the best going forward with your team in the season.
